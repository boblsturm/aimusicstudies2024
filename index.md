## Prospects, Challenges and Methodologies of Studying AI Music in the Humanities

*AI music* (music generated by or with artificial intelligence technologies) 
is now part of the established music ecosystem, and is attracting significant sums of money 
from major private companies. Yet it remains by and large free of critical examination and reflection, 
perhaps with the exception of ethics (e.g., responsible use) and intellectual property (e.g., legal ownership).
This motivates several key questions for critical analysis:
1. How can the AI music ecosystem and its components be formally studied? 
2. What challenges arise in the application of established disciplines, such as musicology? 
3. What considerations must be made to make sense of the emerging AI music ecosystem?
1. What are the prospects and challenges for the new "AI Music Studies"?
2. What is needed in terms of new methodologies for this area of study?
3. Which interdisciplinary connections are required?
4. How are copyright, and intellectual property more generally, being challenged by the emergent music ecosystem being populated by AI music?

*The First International Conference in AI Music Studies 2024* explores the prospects, 
challenges and new methodologies required for the study of AI music within the Humanities. 
It aims to bring together into conversation scholars working in many domains,
including music computing, musicology, ethnomusicology, sound studies, science and technology studies, philosophy, ethics, economics, feminist and posthumanist studies. 
Further motivation for this conference comes from B. L. T. Sturm, K. Déguernel, R. S. Huang, A. Holzapfel, O. Bown, N. Collins, J. Sterne, L. Cros Vila, L. Casini, D. Alberto Cabrera, E. A. Drott, and O. Ben-Tal, “[Musaicology: AI Music and the Need for a New Kind of Music Studies](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9pz4x).” SocArXiv, 2024.
